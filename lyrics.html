            Georgia, wrap me up in all your
            I want you in my arms
            Oh, let me hold you
            I'll never let you go again like I did
            Oh, I used to say

            I would never fall in love again until I found her
            I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
            I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
            I found you

            Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to
            Love her once again
            You fell, I caught you
            I'll never let you go again like I did
            Oh, I used to say

            I would never fall in love again until I found her
            I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
            I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
            I found you
            
            I would never fall in love again until I found her
            I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
            I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
            I found you
